# ABOUT-ME
My name is Olayinka, I am a writer but I want a change of career then, I decided to check into coding. I find coding highly interesting the first time I wrote HELLO WORLD. What makes coding fascinating to me you may ask? I like the fact that I can actually write something some human can't comprehend, then I get to see what I'd "codedly" written.
